# TableTennisTutor

## Description

TableTennisTutor is an innovative software powered by machine learning algorithms. It takes as input a video, analyzes the table tennis shots being played, and classifies them. Following the classification, it pulls up a repository of tutorials and demonstrates how to correctly execute the identified shots. A user-friendly GUI makes the interaction with the software intuitive and straightforward.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for video analysis and shot classification.
- Provides practical tutorials on how to correctly execute identified shots.
- Interactive and user-friendly GUI.
- Follows best practices in data cleaning and preprocessing for model training.

## Installation

To get started with TableTennisTutor, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/zaidharis2801/TableTennisTutor.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory. For example, `cd TableTennisTutor`.
3. Run the application (Specify how to do this based on your project's setup).

## How It Works

TableTennisTutor is powered by machine learning algorithms trained on a diverse dataset of table tennis shots. The software takes as input a user-provided video and processes it, identifying and classifying the shots being played.

Once a shot has been identified, the software consults a comprehensive repository of table tennis tutorials and provides the user with a demonstration on how to execute the shot correctly. This process allows for real-time feedback and learning, assisting users in improving their table tennis skills.

In creating TableTennisTutor, we implemented best practices for data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring high-quality training data for our machine learning model. This rigorous process aids in enhancing the model's performance, accuracy, and generalization capabilities.
